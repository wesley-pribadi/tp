# TAA User Guide

Teacher Assistant's Assistant (TAA) is a **desktop app for Manage all student-related TA matters onto one platform via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/releases/latest).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/A1234567X t/friends t/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete i/3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

Format: `view [STATUS] [d/YYYY-MM-DD] [g/GROUP_NAME] [from/YYYY-MM-DD] [to/YYYY-MM-DD]`

After entering `view` for a session, you can use shorthand follow-up commands without repeating the date/group:

You can still use the full forms if needed:
* mark i/1 d/2026-03-16
* unmark i/1 d/2026-03-16

**Tip:** Not including STATUS as a parameter shows:
* attendance status as [ ] Absent, [X] Present, [-] Uninitialised
* class participation score
* a per-student summary column with attendance totals and average participation

You can optionally narrow the visible session columns with a date range:
* `from/` sets the earliest visible session date

* New sessions start with `UNINITIALISED` attendance and participation value `0`.
* You can optionally attach a short note such as `tutorial`, `lab`, or `make-up`.
* If the session already exists for every student in that class, the command will fail.

Examples:
* `addsession d/2026-03-16`
* `addsession d/2026-03-16 n/tutorial`
* `addsession d/2026-03-16 g/T01`

### Edit a session date : `editsession`

Edits an existing session's date, note, or both for the current group or a specified group.

* At least one of `nd/` or `nn/` must be provided.
* Preserves the attendance and participation values while moving or relabelling the session.
* If a session already exists on the new date for the same student, the command will fail to avoid overwriting data.
* Use `nn/` with no text after it to clear the existing note.

Examples:
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nd/2026-03-23`
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nn/lab`

Deletes an accidentally created session for the current group or a specified group.

Format: `deletesession [confirm] d/YYYY-MM-DD [g/GROUP_NAME]`

* Removes that date's attendance/participation session across all students in the class space.
* If `g/GROUP_NAME` is omitted, the session is deleted from the current class space view.
* If the deleted date is currently highlighted in `view`, the highlight is cleared.
* The command asks for confirmation first. Re-run the same command with `confirm` in front to proceed.

Examples:
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16`
* `deletesession confirm d/2026-03-16`
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16 g/T01`

### Export the current view : `exportview`

Exports the currently displayed `view` matrix to a CSV file.

Format: `exportview [f/FILE_PATH]`

* Works when you are in a class space view.
* Exports the currently displayed rows and the session columns currently visible in `view`.

### Undo the last session change : `undosession`

Reverts the most recent session-related change.

Format: `undosession`

* Works for recent session changes such as `addsession`, `editsession`, confirmed `deletesession`, `mark`, `unmark`, and `part`.

* assignments are unique within a class space
* the same assignment name can exist in different class spaces
* when a student is added to a class, they automatically show all class assignments as ungraded
* when a student is removed from a class, their grades for that class’s assignments are removed
* when a class is deleted, its assignments and grades are deleted too

Examples:

* grade must be between 0 and max marks
* grading again overwrites the old grade

Examples:
*  `gradeassignment a/Quiz 1 m/A1234567X m/A2345678L gr/17` Assigns a grade of 17 for the assignment `Quiz 1` to the students with matriculation number A1234567X and A2345678L for the group in current view.

### Exiting the program : `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Saving the data

AddressBook data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

AddressBook data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.  Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause the AddressBook to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

_Details coming soon ..._

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous AddressBook home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
