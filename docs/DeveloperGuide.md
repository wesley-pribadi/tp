## **Design**

### Architecture

-> <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="400px"/> <-

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1`.

-> <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650px"/> <-

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

-> <puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300px"/> <-

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="500px"/> <-

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

-> <puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

-> <puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="850px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

-> <puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600px"/> <-

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450px"/> <-
-> <puml src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.puml" width="800px"/> <-

<div class="invisible-table">

|                                                               |                                                             |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| <puml src="diagrams/SessionClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> | <puml src="diagrams/GroupClassDiagram.puml" width="300px"/> |

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores each `Group`'s assignments (all `Assignment` objects which are contained in a `UniqueAssignmentList` object within each `Group`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores each `Person`'s session data (all `Session` objects, each containing a `LocalDate`, `Attendance`, and `Participation`, which are contained in a `SessionList` object within each `Person`), keyed by `GroupName` with one `SessionList` per group.
* stores each `Person`'s assignment grades as a mapping of `GroupName` to `AssignmentName` to grade, allowing for per-group assignment grade tracking.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

-> <puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="800px"/> <-

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Storage` component when data is loaded during initialization.

-> <puml src="diagrams/StorageLoadSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `JsonSerializableAddressBook` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the load works:
* `JsonAddressBookStorage` delegates to `JsonSerializableAddressBook#toModelType()` to parse the JSON data into `Model` objects. During this process, each person and group entry is validated against the current group and assignment data.
* Entries with invalid fields, missing group references, or inconsistent assignment grades are skipped rather than causing the entire load to fail. The app continues loading with the remaining valid entries.
* Skipped entries are preserved back into the data file on the next save, so no data is permanently lost. Warnings generated during this process are retrieved via `StorageManager#getLastLoadWarnings()` and displayed to the user on startup.
* Previously skipped entries are re-attempted on every subsequent load. If the underlying issue has been resolved (e.g., a missing group was manually added back to the file), the entry will be successfully loaded on the next launch.
* If the data file is blank or empty, the app loads sample data instead. If the file contains malformed JSON, the app starts with an empty address book and blocks all saves for that session to prevent overwriting the original file.

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Matriculation number validation

The algorithm can be found [here](http://interrobeng.com/2014/01/19/nus-matriculation-number-check-digit-algorithm/).

Format: Valid matriculation number has form of `A`, followed by 7 digits ($d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7$) , and ending with a checksum letter.

The checksum calculation is done by `MatricNumber#calculateChecksum(String matricNumber)`. <br>
The checksum letter is one of the following 13 letters: `Y X W U R N M L J H E A B`.

Step 1. Extract digits $d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7$. <br>
Step 2. Compute the `sum` of the 6 digits above.<br>
Step 3. Map the `remainder` to a checksum letter by computing `remainder = sum % 13`.

|    r    | 0  | 1  |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|:-------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| Letter  | Y  | X  |  W |  U |  R |  N |  M |  L |  J | H  |  E |  A |  B |

**Examples:**

The table below shows one matric number that produces each of the 13 possible check letters.

|  Matric number  | Digits d2–d7 | Digit sum | mod 13 | Check letter |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:------:|:------------:|
|   `A0308002Y`   | 0,3,0,8,0,2  |    13     |   0    | Y            |
|   `A0308003X`   | 0,3,0,8,0,3  |    14     |   1    | X            |
|   `A0308004W`   | 0,3,0,8,0,4  |    15     |   2    | W            |

|   `A0308008M`   | 0,3,0,8,0,8  |    19     |   6    | M            |
|   `A0308009L`   | 0,3,0,8,0,9  |    20     |   7    | L            |
|   `A0308019J`   | 0,3,0,8,1,9  |    21     |   8    | J            |
|   `A0308029H`   | 0,3,0,8,2,9  |    22     |   9    | H            |
|   `A0308039E`   | 0,3,0,8,3,9  |    23     |   10   | E            |
|   `A0308000A`   | 0,3,0,8,0,0  |    11     |   11   | A            |
|   `A0308001B`   | 0,3,0,8,0,1  |    12     |   12   | B            |


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" width="400px"/> <-

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" width="400px"/> <-

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" width="400px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" width="400px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="550px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" width="500px"/> <-

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" width="400px"/> <-

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" width="500px"/> <-

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

-> <puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="300px"/> <-

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. The app shall run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, with Java 17 without requiring external dependencies not bundled in the packaged app.
2. The app shall be able to run fully offline without network connection.
3. The app shall handle up to 1000 contacts without noticeable sluggishness in performance (respond in under 1 second) for typical usage (listing, finding, modifying contacts) on a modern computer.
4. The app shall save contact data automatically to persistent storage after any data mutations, and shall alert the user if it detects problems saving data.
5. The app shall provide a descriptive error message for invalid commands and shall not crash on malformed user input.
6. Users with above-average typing speed for regular English text (not code, not terminal commands) should be able to complete typical tasks faster using keyboard commands than with a mouse.
7. The codebase shall largely follow Object Oriented Programming principles.

### Difficulties & Challenges

One major challenge was evolving AddressBook into a domain-specific application for TAs while still keeping the codebase maintainable. In particular, extending the model to support tutorial groups, per-group sessions, attendance, participation, and assignment grades required careful design to avoid tightly coupling unrelated features.

Another challenge was preserving a smooth CLI workflow while introducing richer group-based and date-based operations. Commands such as attendance marking, participation recording, session management, and view filtering required additional parser and model logic, while still needing to remain intuitive for users.

The team also had to ensure that invalid or partially corrupted saved data would not cause the entire application to fail. This required additional validation and recovery logic during loading, together with meaningful warnings for the user.

### Effort & Achievements

The project required substantial effort in both feature development and adaptation of the original architecture. Compared to the original AB3 codebase, TAA now supports tutorial-group management, attendance and participation tracking by session date, assignment management within groups, and filtered class views for teaching workflows.

The team also improved robustness by validating saved data during loading, preserving skipped invalid entries, and surfacing warnings to the user instead of failing silently. On the UI side, the app was adapted to support attendance-oriented views and clearer group/session context.

Overall, our team successfully transformed a generic contact-management application into a more task-focused teaching assistant management tool while preserving the strengths of the original CLI-based workflow.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

1. Add undo/redo support for data-changing commands.
2. Improve the attendance and participation UI further for better readability across long academic timelines.
3. Support importing and exporting data in more convenient formats such as CSV.
4. Add recurring-session support for tutorial groups so weekly schedules can be created more efficiently.
5. Improve accessibility through additional colour themes and colour-blind-friendly display options.
6. Add more powerful search and filtering, such as combined filters for group, attendance, and assignment progress.
7. Provide command shortcuts or aliases for frequently used workflows.
8. Expand support for per-student notes and reminders.
