## Features

<box type="info">

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/scholar` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including 0 times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as `t/scholar`, `t/scholar t/exchangeStudent` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

**This command only works when you are in a group view.**

Format: `exportview [f/FILE_NAME.csv]`

* Exports the currently displayed rows and the session columns currently visible in `view g/GROUP_NAME`.
* If no file name is provided, TAA will write to `[JAR file location]/view-export.csv`.
* If a file name is provided, TAA will write to `[JAR file location]/[FILE_NAME]`

<box type=warning>

**IMPORTANT:**
If you provide a file name, you will need to append `.csv` at the back of it.
TAA will not automatically append `.csv` at the back of your given file name.
</box>

Examples:
* `exportview`
* `exportview f/exports/t01-view.csv`

#### CSV file format

Each row represents one student.

The columns are arranged as follows:

- The first column is `Student`.
- The remaining columns are grouped by date.
- For each date, there are two columns:
  - `<date> Attendance`
  - `<date> Participation`

Example:

| Student     | 2026-04-01 Attendance | 2026-04-01 Participation |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| John Doe    | PRESENT               | 0                        |
| Philip Cap  | PRESENT               | 0                        |
| Brendan Tan | ABSENT                | 0                        |

* The exported CSV file contains the students currently shown in the view.
* If you export again to the same file path, the existing file **will be overwritten**. 
* If you want to keep an older export, save it to a different location or rename the file before exporting again.

<box type="warning">

**IMPORTANT:**
Avoid illegal filename characters such as `/`, `\`, `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, and `|` in the export file name.
<br> TAA will reject file names containing these characters and ask you to choose a different name.

</box>

<panel id="faq-first_time" header="What happens when I launch TAA for the first time?" type="seamless" expanded>

When you first launch TAA, a `data` folder should be created containing `TAA_savefile.json`, which is where the data is stored.
<br> Sample data will be populated onto TAA. To clear all existing data and begin your use of TAA, run the command `clear`.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-resize" header="Can I resize the input bar and response boxes?" type="seamless" expanded>

You can drag the divider between the command input bar and the response box, and the divider between the response box and the contact list, to resize them to fit your display as needed.
</panel>

<panel id="faq-backup" header="How do I back up my data?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
2. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
3. Copy the `data` folder to another location of your choice.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-transfer" header="How do I transfer my data to another computer?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Ensure you have the [latest version of TAA installed](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/releases) on the new computer.
2. On your old computer, open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
3. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
4. Copy this `data` folder into another location of your choice on your new computer.
5. Launch TAA on your new computer. A new `data` folder will be created. Replace this with the version from your old computer.
6. Relaunch TAA. Your data should appear as they did in your old computer.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-not_working" header="I edited the save file manually and TAA no longer works. What should I do?" type="seamless" expanded>

You should refer to the following FAQs for help on how to fix invalid students or groups:
* [What happens if my manually edited students are invalid?](#faq-invalid_persons)
* [What happens if my manually edited groups are invalid?](#faq-invalid_groups)

You can also refer to the section on [editing your save file](#editing-the-save-file) to see if there is any mismatch in format of your save file.

Alternatively, you can do the following:
* Restore from your previous backup: If you made a backup of your save file before editing, you can restore your work by replacing the `data` folder with the backup.
* Start with a new save file: If no backup was made, you can delete the existing `data` folder, or choose to copy it to another location while you try to fix the `TAA_savefile.json`.
  This will create a new save file when you launch TAA, allowing you to continue using it.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-unknown_sections" header="I see `preservedSkippedPersons`, `preservedSkippedGroups` and `loadWarnings` in my save file. What are they?" type="seamless" expanded>

These sections will be loaded into your save file once you start TAA.
<br> You can safely ignore these sections unless you want to start manually [editing your save file](#editing-the-save-file).

```json
  "preservedSkippedPersons" : [ ],
  "preservedSkippedGroups" : [ ],
  "loadWarnings" : [ ]
```

* `preservedSkippedPersons` holds all invalid students.
* `preservedSkippedGroups` holds all invalid groups.
* `loadWarnings` holds warning messages, telling you why the respective student(s) or group(s) are invalid. <br>

<box type="tip">

**Tip:**
You can read the <code>loadWarnings</code> as a reference to fix your save file.
<br> If you fix all errors and rerun TAA, the warnings will be cleared. 
<br> If errors remain, you will see updated warnings reflecting any outstanding issues.
</box>

</panel>

<panel id="faq-invalid_persons" header="What happens if my manually edited students are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many students are invalid once TAA starts running. 

<box type="warning">

**IMPORTANT:**
Please close TAA before fixing the student details, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the save file to see the errors for each student.

</box>

You can fix the invalid student details by editing them in the <code>preservedSkippedPersons</code> section of the save file.<br>
Once these students are valid, TAA will automatically load these students on the next run and clear the <code>loadWarnings</code>.

<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedPersons` looks like if you run TAA with an invalid student!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
{
  "preservedSkippedPersons" : [ {

    }
  } ],
  "loadWarnings": [
    "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- The matric number checksum letter is incorrect. For the given digits, it should be 'X'."
  ]
}
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that `John` has an invalid matric number checksum and that it should be `X`. You can fix this by editing the matric number from `A1234567Y` to `A1234567X`. <br>
Rerun TAA and `John` will now be loaded into the contact list!

<panel id="faq-invalid_groups" header="What happens if my manually edited groups are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many groups are invalid once TAA starts running.

<box type="warning">

**IMPORTANT:**
Please close TAA before fixing the groups, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the save file to see the errors for each group.

</box>

<box type="info">

**Info:**
Students that reference invalid groups will be considered invalid and moved to `preservedSkippedPersons`.<br>
They will automatically be loaded back once the invalid group is fixed in `preservedSkippedGroups`.

</box>

You can fix the invalid groups by editing them in the <code>preservedSkippedGroups</code> section of the save file.<br>
Once the groups are valid, TAA will automatically load these groups on the next run and clear the <code>loadWarnings</code>.

<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedGroups` looks if you run TAA with an invalid group!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
{
  "preservedSkippedPersons": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "phone": "12345678",

      "matricNumber": "A1234567X",
      "tags": [],

    {
      "name": "T02#",

    "Skipped invalid group 'T02#':\n- Group names should only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores, and it should not be blank.",
    "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- Contact references group 'T02' which does not exist yet."
  ]
}
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that the group `T02#` contains an illegal character, and `John` is invalid since group `T02` does not exist. You can fix this by fixing the group name to be `T02` in `preservedSkippedGroups`.<br>
Rerun TAA and group `T02` will exist. `John` will also be loaded into the contact list and remains a part of `T02`!

</panel>

<panel id="faq-duplicate" header="What is considered a duplicate student?" type="seamless" expanded>

TAA considers 2 students to be duplicates if they share the same matric number (case-insensitive).

This means that:
- Two students with the same name but different matric numbers **are not** duplicates and can both exist. 
- Two students with different names but the same matric number **are** duplicates.

If you try to `add` a student whose matric number already exists, or `edit` a student such that its matric number would match an existing student, TAA will reject it and not make any changes to the app.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-edit_tags" header="What happens when I edit the tags of a student?" type="seamless" expanded>

All existing tags of the student will be removed and replaced by any new tags you add when running `edit i/INDEX t/TAG`. This means that adding tags is not cumulative. <br>
**Here's an example**: if a student has tags of `t/groupB` and `t/exchangeStudent`, running the command `edit i/INDEX t/groupA` will result in the student only having the `t/groupA` tag.


</panel>

<panel id="faq-remove_tags" header="How can I remove all tags from a student?" type="seamless" expanded>

You can remove all tags from a student by running `edit i/INDEX t/`, without specifying any tags.
