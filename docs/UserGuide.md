TAA User Guide

</div>

Are you a NUS Teaching Assistant (TA) struggling to **keep track of your student's data** between spreadsheets and different apps? 
<br>Are you a TA that prefers **typing commands** over clicking through menus?

Look no further! Teacher Assistant's Assistant (TAA) is a **desktop app that consolidates all your student management needs in one place**. 
It leverages the speed of fast typists while maintaining a clean visual display, so you can manage students and track assignments, participation, and attendance — all without leaving your keyboard!

Spend less time organizing data and more time focusing on what matters most: **teaching**.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Core Concepts

Before diving into features, let's learn how TAA organises your data.

### Students vs Session Data

TAA manages **two types of information**:

* **Static information (per student):**
  * Name, phone, email, matric number, tags
  * Used for identifying and contacting students
* **Session-based information (per group, per date):**
  * Attendance
  * Participation
  * Assignment grades

👉 This means a student can have different attendance, participation, and grades across different groups and dates.

---

### Groups as Context

Most actions in TAA happen within a **group context**.

- You switch into a group using:
```
switchgroup g/GROUP_NAME
```
- Then perform actions like:
- `mark`, `unmark` (attendance)
- `part` (participation)
- `view` (session overview)
- `createassignment`, `gradeassignment`

👉 Think of it as: “I am currently working in this group.”

---

### Layouts Control What You See and Edit

TAA has different layouts:

- `list` → shows a list of students in the current group
- `view` → shows an overview of attendance and participation across sessions

👉 Important:
- Commands act on **what is currently displayed**
- Always check your **current group** before running commands (shown bottom right of the app)

---

### Index-based Operations

Many commands use `i/INDEX` or `i/INDEX_EXPRESSION`.

- Indexes change depending on your current group

👉 Tip: Run `list` or `view` before using index-based commands to avoid mistakes.

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Recommended Workflows

Instead of memorising commands, you can follow these common workflows.

### Adding and organizing students

1. Add students:
```
add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/A1234567X
```

2. Create a group:
```
creategroup g/2026-S1-T01
```

3. Add students to the group:
```
addtogroup g/2026-s1-t01 i/1-5
```
<box type="info" light>

Note how group names can be specified case-insensitively for convenience.

</box>

---

### Taking attendance for a class

1. Switch to the group:
```
switchgroup g/2026-s1-t01
```

2. Open or focus on a session:
```
view d/2026-03-16
```

3. Mark students as present:
```
mark i/1-10
```

4. Mark absentees:
```
unmark i/3
```

---

### Recording participation

After opening a session:

```
part i/1 pv/4
```

- Participation values range from 0 to 5

---

### Managing assignments

1. Create an assignment:
```
createassignment a/Quiz 1 d/2026-04-05 mm/20
```

<box type="info" light>

Type `createa` and press TAB on your keyboard to autocomplete commands. 

</box>

2. Grade students:
```
gradeassignment a/Quiz 1 i/1-5 gr/18
```

---

### Exporting data

Export the current session view to a CSV file:

```
exportview f/t01-view.csv
```

---

### General usage pattern

Most workflows follow this pattern:

1. **Select a group**
2. **Open a view (`list` or `view`)**
3. **Perform actions using indexes**

👉 If something doesn’t work, check that you're in the right Group

## Command Parameters and their Rules

This section describes the valid formats for commonly used fields in TAA commands.

You don't need to memorise everything — refer back here if a command fails due to invalid input.

<box type="info" light>

**Info:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. `NAME` in `add n/NAME` is a parameter which can be used like `add n/John Doe`

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/scholar` or as `n/John Doe`

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including 0 times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as `t/scholar` or `t/scholar t/exchangeStudent`

* Additional parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. `help 123` will run `help`

* When using the PDF version of this User Guide, be careful when copy-pasting commands with multiple lines as spaces across lines might be omitted.

</box>

---

### Index Expressions

Many commands in TAA accept an `i/INDEX` or `i/INDEX_EXPRESSION` parameter to refer to one or more students.  The index refers to the position shown in the current list or view.

Supported formats:
* `INDEX`
  * Single index: `i/1`
* `INDEX_EXPRESSION`
  * Multiple indexes: `i/1,2,4`
  * Ranges: `i/1-4`
  * Mixed: `i/1,3-5`

Rules:
* Indexes must be **positive integers** (1, 2, 3, …)
* Ranges must be in **ascending order** (`i/3-2` is invalid)
* Indexes must correspond to valid entries in the current `list`/`view`

Format: `part i/INDEX_EXPRESSION d/YYYY-MM-DD pv/PARTICIPATION_VALUE`

* `PARTICIPATION_VALUE` **must be an integer from 0 to 5.**
* The participation will be assigned for the current group.

Examples:
*  `part i/1 d/2026-03-16 pv/4` Assigns a participation level of 4 on the 16 of March 2026 for the student at index 1 for the current list.

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**
TAA allows assigning participation value for absent students.<br>
For example, to account for take-home assignments.

</box>

---

### Mark student attendance as present: `mark`

Marks the attendance for a student in a group as PRESENT for a particular date.

**Tip:**
TAA allows marking attendance for future sessions.<br>
For example, you can mark a student on long-term medical leave as absent, or mark the whole class present in advance and adjust on the actual day.

</box>

---

### Mark student attendance as absent: `unmark`

Marks the attendance for a student in a group as ABSENT for a particular date.

Format: `unmark i/INDEX_EXPRESSION d/YYYY-MM-DD`

* The attendance will be assigned for the current group.

Examples:
*  `unmark i/1 d/2026-03-16` Mark the attendance of the student at index 1 of the current list as ABSENT for the 16 of March 2026.

<box type="tip" light>

You must mark absences manually with the `unmark` command.
</box>

---

### See overview of attendance and participation: `view`

Shows the attendance and participation overview for the current group. <br>

Format: `view [STATUS] [d/YYYY-MM-DD] [from/YYYY-MM-DD] [to/YYYY-MM-DD] [g/GROUP_NAME] `

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:** You can supply `[g/GROUP_NAME]` as a shortcut to [`switchgroup`](#switching-view-of-groups-switchgroup).

</box>

After using `view d/YYYY-MM-DD`, you can use shorthand follow-up commands without repeating the date or group:
* `mark i/1`
* `unmark i/1`
* `part i/1 pv/4`

You can still use the full forms if needed:
* `mark i/1 d/2026-03-16`
* `unmark i/1 d/2026-03-16`
* `part i/1 d/2026-03-16 pv/4`

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**

By default (no `STATUS` specified in command), the overview will show:
* Attendance status as `[ ] Absent`, `[X] Present`, `[-] Uninitialised`.
* Class participation scores.

You can optionally narrow the visible session columns with a date range:
* `from/` sets the earliest visible session date.
* `to/` sets the latest visible session date.
* Both `from/` and `to/` can be used together:
    * Example: `view from/2026-01-20 to/2026-01-30`
    * `from/` cannot be later than `to/`.

* Use `nn/` with no text after it to clear the existing note.
* Editing a session preserves the student's attendance and participation values.
* If a session already exists on the new date for the same student, the command will be rejected to avoid overwriting data.

Examples:
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nd/2026-03-23`
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nn/lab`
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nd/2026-03-23 nn/make-up tutorial`
* `editsession d/2026-03-16 nd/2026-03-23 g/T01`

---

### Delete a session: `deletesession`

Deletes a session for the current group or a specified group.

Format: `deletesession d/YYYY-MM-DD [g/GROUP_NAME]`

* Removes that date's session (and attendance/participation) across all students in the group.
* If `g/GROUP_NAME` is omitted, the session is deleted from the current group.
* If the deleted date is currently highlighted in `view`, the highlight is cleared.

Examples:
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16`
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16 g/T01`

### Export the current session overview: `exportview`


<box type="info" light>

**Info:** This command only works when you are in a group.

</box>

Exports the currently displayed `view` matrix to a CSV-formatted file. <br>

Format: `exportview [f/FILE_NAME]`

* The exported CSV file contains the students shown in the current session overview.
* If no file name is provided, TAA will write to `[JAR file location]/view-export.csv`.
* If a file name is provided, TAA will write to `[JAR file location]/[FILE_NAME]`

Examples:
* `exportview`
* `exportview f/exports/t01-view.csv`

<box type="warning" light>

**Warning:**

**If you provide a file name, you will need to append `.csv` to the end**.

TAA will not automatically append `.csv` at the back of your given file name.

</box>

#### CSV file format

The exported CSV file contains the students shown in the current session overview.

Each row represents one student.

The columns are arranged as follows:
- The first column is `Student`.
- The remaining columns are grouped by date.
- For each date, there are two columns:
  - `<date> Attendance`
  - `<date> Participation`

Example:

| Student     | 2026-04-01 Attendance | 2026-04-01 Participation |
|-------------|-----------------------|--------------------------|
| John Doe    | PRESENT               | 0                        |
| Philip Cap  | PRESENT               | 0                        |
| Brendan Tan | ABSENT                | 0                        |


<box type="warning" light>

**Warnings:**

* **If you export again to the same file path, the existing file will be overwritten**. If you want to keep an older export, save it to a different location or rename the file before exporting again.

* Avoid illegal filename characters such as `:`, `*`, `?`, `"`, `<`, `>`, and `|` in FILE_NAME, and only use `/` or `\` for the filepath. TAA will reject file names containing these characters and ask you to choose a different name.

</box>

---

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from TAA. This includes all students, groups, assignments and sessions.

Format: `clear`

---

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Managing your data and save file

### Saving the data

Your data will be saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/TAA_savefile.json` after any command that changes the data.
You do not need to save any changes manually.

---

### Editing the save file

You are welcome to update data directly by editing the `TAA_savefile.json` save file. 
You are recommended to back up your data before beginning.

You can edit the save file using pre-installed text editors found on your computer:
* **Windows:** Notepad

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

<panel id="faq-first_time" header="What happens when I launch TAA for the first time?" type="seamless" expanded>

When you first launch TAA, a `data` folder should be created containing `TAA_savefile.json`, which is where the data is stored.
<br> Sample data will be populated onto TAA. To clear all existing data and begin your use of TAA, run `clear`.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-resizeable_handles" header="Can I resize the input and response text areas?" type="seamless" expanded>

Yes, you can click and vertically drag the bar between the input, response, and layout areas. It lights up when you mouse over it.
You can resize things to best suit your display arrangement.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-duplicate" header="What is considered a duplicate student?" type="seamless" expanded>

TAA considers 2 students to be duplicates if they share the same matric number (case-insensitive).

This means that:
- Two students with the same name but different matric numbers **are not** duplicates and can both exist.
- Two students with different names but the same matric number **are** duplicates.

If you try to `add` a student whose matric number already exists, or `edit` a student such that its matric number would match an existing student, TAA will reject it and not make any changes to the app.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-edit_tags" header="What happens when I edit the tags of a student?" type="seamless" expanded>

All existing tags of the student will be removed and replaced by any new tags you add when running `edit i/INDEX t/TAG`. This means that adding tags is not cumulative. <br>
**Here's an example**: if a student has tags of `t/groupB` and `t/exchangeStudent`, running the command `edit i/INDEX t/groupA` will result in the student only having the `t/groupA` tag.


</panel>

<panel id="faq-remove_tags" header="How can I remove all tags from a student?" type="seamless" expanded>

You can remove all tags from a student by running `edit i/INDEX t/`, without specifying any tags.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-backup" header="How do I back up my data?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
2. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
3. Copy the `data` folder to another location of your choice.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-transfer" header="How do I transfer my data to another computer?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Ensure you have the [latest version of TAA installed](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/releases) on the new computer.
2. On your old computer, open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
3. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
4. Copy this `data` folder into another location of your choice on your new computer.
5. Launch TAA on your new computer. A new `data` folder will be created. Replace this with the version from your old computer.
6. Relaunch TAA. Your data should appear as they did in your old computer.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-not_working" header="I edited the save file manually and TAA no longer works. What should I do?" type="seamless" expanded>

You should refer to the following FAQs for help on how to fix invalid students or groups:
* [What happens if my manually edited students are invalid?](#faq-invalid_persons)
* [What happens if my manually edited groups are invalid?](#faq-invalid_groups)

You can also refer to the section on [editing your save file](#editing-the-save-file) to see if there is any mismatch in format of your save file.

Alternatively, you can do the following:
* Restore from your previous backup: If you made a backup of your save file before editing, you can restore your work by replacing the `data` folder with the backup.
* Start with a new save file: If no backup was made, you can delete the existing `data` folder, or choose to copy it to another location while you try to fix the `TAA_savefile.json`.
  This will create a new save file when you launch TAA, allowing you to continue using it.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-unknown_sections" header="I see `preservedSkippedPersons`, `preservedSkippedGroups` and `loadWarnings` in my save file. What are they?" type="seamless" expanded>

These sections will be loaded into your save file once you start TAA.
<br> You can safely ignore these sections unless you want to start manually [editing your save file](#editing-the-save-file).

```json
  "preservedSkippedPersons" : [ ],
  "preservedSkippedGroups" : [ ],
  "loadWarnings" : [ ]
```

* `preservedSkippedPersons` holds all invalid students.
* `preservedSkippedGroups` holds all invalid groups.
* `loadWarnings` holds warning messages, telling you why the respective student(s) or group(s) are invalid. <br>

<box type="tip" light>

**Tip:**
You can read the `loadWarnings` as a reference to fix your save file.
<br> If you fix all errors and rerun TAA, the warnings will be cleared. 
<br> If errors remain, you will see updated warnings reflecting any outstanding issues.
</box>

</panel>

<panel id="faq-invalid_persons" header="What happens if my manually edited students are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many students are invalid once TAA starts running. 

<box type="warning" light>

**Warning:**
Please close TAA before fixing the student details, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the save file to see the errors for each student.

</box>

You can fix the invalid student details by editing them in the `preservedSkippedPersons` section of the save file.<br>
Once these students are valid, TAA will automatically load these students on the next run and clear the `loadWarnings`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedPersons` looks like if you run TAA with an invalid student!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
{
  "preservedSkippedPersons" : [ {
    "name" : "John",
    "phone" : "12345678",
    "email" : "example@gmail.com",
    "matricNumber" : "A1234567Y",
    "tags" : [ ],
    "groups" : [ ],
    "groupSessions" : { },
    "assignmentGrades" : { }
  } ],
  "loadWarnings": [
    "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- The matric number checksum letter is incorrect.",
    "For the given digits, it should be 'X'."
  ]
}
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that `John` has an invalid matric number checksum and that it should be `X`. You can fix this by editing the matric number from `A1234567Y` to `A1234567X`. <br>
Rerun TAA and `John` will now be loaded into the contact list!

</panel>

</panel>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<panel id="faq-invalid_groups" header="What happens if my manually edited groups are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many groups are invalid once TAA starts running.

You can fix the invalid groups by editing them in the `preservedSkippedGroups` section of the save file.<br>
Once the groups are valid, TAA will automatically load these groups on the next run and clear the `loadWarnings`.

<box type="warning" light>

**Warning:**
Please close TAA before fixing the groups, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the save file to see the errors for each group.

</box>

<box type="info" light>

**Info:**
Students that reference invalid groups will be considered invalid and moved to `preservedSkippedPersons`.<br>
They will automatically be loaded back once the invalid group is fixed in `preservedSkippedGroups`.

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedGroups` looks if you run TAA with an invalid group!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
{
  "preservedSkippedPersons": [
    {
      "name": "John",
      "phone": "12345678",
      "email": "example@gmail.com",
      "matricNumber": "A1234567X",
      "tags": [],

            "participation": 3,

          }
        ]
      },
      "assignmentGrades": {
        "T02": {
          "Assignment 1": 100
        }
      }
    }
  ],
  "preservedSkippedGroups": [
    {
      "name": "T02#",
      "assignments": [
        {
          "name": "Assignment 1",
          "dueDate": "2026-05-01",
          "maxMarks": 100
        }
      ],
      "sessions": [
        {
          "date": "2026-04-03",
          "attendance": "UNINITIALISED",
          "participation": 0,
          "note": ""
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "loadWarnings": [
    "Skipped invalid group 'T02#':\n- Group names should only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens,",
    "and underscores, and it should not be blank.",
    "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- Contact references group 'T02' which does not exist yet."
  ]
}
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that the group `T02#` contains an illegal character, and `John` is invalid since group `T02` does not exist. You can fix this by fixing the group name to be `T02` in `preservedSkippedGroups`.<br>
Rerun TAA and group `T02` will exist. `John` will also be loaded into the contact list and remains a part of `T02`!
