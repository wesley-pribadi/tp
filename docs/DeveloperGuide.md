## **Acknowledgements**

* The algorithm used to calculate the matric number checksum was posted by Beng Hee Eu. It can be found [here](http://interrobeng.com/2014/01/19/nus-matriculation-number-check-digit-algorithm/). Our implementation was made based on his algorithm.

## **Design**

### Architecture

-> <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="400px"/> <-

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.

* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete i/1`.

-> <puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="650px"/> <-

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

-> <puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300px"/> <-

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component" width="500px"/> <-

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

-> <puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example.

-> <puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" width="850px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

-> <puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600px"/> <-

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450px"/> <-
-> <puml src="diagrams/PersonClassDiagram.puml" width="800px"/> <-

<div class="invisible-table">

|                                                               |                                                             |
|:-------------------------------------------------------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------:|
| <puml src="diagrams/SessionClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> | <puml src="diagrams/GroupClassDiagram.puml" width="300px"/> |

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores each `Group`'s assignments (all `Assignment` objects which are contained in a `UniqueAssignmentList` object within each `Group`).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores each `Person`'s session data (all `Session` objects, each containing a `LocalDate`, `Attendance`, and `Participation`, which are contained in a `SessionList` object within each `Person`), keyed by `GroupName` with one `SessionList` per group.
* stores each `Person`'s assignment grades as a mapping of `GroupName` to `AssignmentName` to grade, allowing for per-group assignment grade tracking.
* stores a `UserPrefs` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPrefs` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

-> <puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

</box>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

-> <puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="800px"/> <-

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Storage` component when data is loaded during initialization.

-> <puml src="diagrams/StorageLoadSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `JsonSerializableAddressBook` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.

</box>

How the load works:
* `JsonAddressBookStorage` delegates to `JsonSerializableAddressBook#toModelType()` to parse the JSON data into `Model` objects. During this process, each person and group entry is validated against the current group and assignment data.
* Entries with invalid fields, missing group references, or inconsistent assignment grades are skipped rather than causing the entire load to fail. The app continues loading with the remaining valid entries.
* Skipped entries are preserved back into the data file on the next save, so no data is permanently lost. Warnings generated during this process are retrieved via `StorageManager#getLastLoadWarnings()` and displayed to the user on startup.
* Previously skipped entries are re-attempted on every subsequent load. If the underlying issue has been resolved (e.g., a missing group was manually added back to the file), the entry will be successfully loaded on the next launch.
* If the data file is blank or empty, the app loads sample data instead. If the file contains malformed JSON, the app starts with an empty address book and blocks all saves for that session to prevent overwriting the original file.

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Matric number validation

The algorithm can be found [here](http://interrobeng.com/2014/01/19/nus-matriculation-number-check-digit-algorithm/).

Format: Valid matric number has form of `A`, followed by 7 digits ($d_1 d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7$) , and ending with a checksum letter.

The checksum calculation is done by `MatricNumber#calculateChecksum(String matricNumber)`. <br>
The checksum letter is one of the following 13 letters: `Y X W U R N M L J H E A B`.

Step 1. Extract digits $d_2 d_3 d_4 d_5 d_6 d_7$. <br>
Step 2. Compute the `sum` of the 6 digits above.<br>
Step 3. Map the `remainder` to a checksum letter by computing `remainder = sum % 13`.

| remainder | 0  | 1  |  2 |  3 |  4 |  5 |  6 |  7 |  8 | 9  | 10 | 11 | 12 |
|:---------:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
|  Letter   | Y  | X  |  W |  U |  R |  N |  M |  L |  J | H  |  E |  A |  B |

**Examples:**

The table below shows one matric number that produces each of the 13 possible check letters.

|  Matric number  | Digits d2–d7 | Digit sum | mod 13 | Check letter |
|:---------------:|:------------:|:---------:|:------:|:------------:|
|   `A0308002Y`   | 0,3,0,8,0,2  |    13     |   0    | Y            |
|   `A0308003X`   | 0,3,0,8,0,3  |    14     |   1    | X            |
|   `A0308004W`   | 0,3,0,8,0,4  |    15     |   2    | W            |
|   `A0308005U`   | 0,3,0,8,0,5  |    16     |   3    | U            |

|   `A0308007N`   | 0,3,0,8,0,7  |    18     |   5    | N            |
|   `A0308008M`   | 0,3,0,8,0,8  |    19     |   6    | M            |
|   `A0308009L`   | 0,3,0,8,0,9  |    20     |   7    | L            |
|   `A0308019J`   | 0,3,0,8,1,9  |    21     |   8    | J            |
|   `A0308029H`   | 0,3,0,8,2,9  |    22     |   9    | H            |
|   `A0308039E`   | 0,3,0,8,3,9  |    23     |   10   | E            |

|   `A0308001B`   | 0,3,0,8,0,1  |    12     |   12   | B            |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command Tab Completion Feature

The **command tab completion** feature provides real-time command suggestions and contextual parameter help as the user types, with the ability to accept suggestions via the TAB key.

#### How It Works

The feature leverages three key components:

1. **CommandRegistry** - A centralized registry containing all available commands and their parameters help-string
2. **CommandBox (UI)** - The input component that listens to user input and manages suggestion display
3. **Ghost Text Label** - A visual overlay showing faded suggestions for intuitive completion

The architecture works as follows:

-> <puml src="diagrams/CommandTabCompletionSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Command Tab Completion Feature" width="700px"/> <-

#### Detailed Flow

**Step 1: Initialization**
- When `CommandBox` is created, it extracts all command words from `CommandRegistry.COMMAND_ATTRIBUTES` and creates a sorted list of `COMMAND_SUGGESTIONS`

**Step 2: User Types**
- As the user types in the `TextArea`, a text change listener triggers two updates:
    - `updateGhostText()`: Finds and displays matching command suggestions as faded text
    - `updateContextualHelp()`: Shows command parameters in the result display panel

**Step 3: Ghost Text Generation**
- The `findSuggestion()` method performs a prefix match against `COMMAND_SUGGESTIONS`
- The first matching command (e.g., typing "a" returns "add") is displayed in the `ghostTextLabel` with semi-transparent styling
- The suggestion is cleared if the input contains spaces or multiple words

**Step 4: TAB Key Completion**
- When the user presses TAB, the current ghost text suggestion is inserted into the command box
- A space is automatically appended, positioning the cursor for parameter entry
- The ghost text is cleared

**Step 5: Contextual Help**
- The `updateContextualHelp()` method extracts the command word and looks up its parameters in `CommandRegistry`
- Parameters (e.g., "NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL") are displayed in the result display area
- When the user clears the command or switches commands, the previously displayed text is restored

#### Class Diagram

-> <puml src="diagrams/CommandTabCompletionClassDiagram.puml" alt="Command Tab Completion Class Structure" width="600px"/> <-

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to store command metadata**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Use a centralized `CommandRegistry` with a static `COMMAND_ATTRIBUTES` map
    * Pros: Easy to maintain; single source of truth; decoupled from UI
    * Cons: Requires manual registration of each command (risk of developer error); slight overhead from map lookups

* **Option 2:** Store parameters within each Command class
    * Pros: Commands are self-documenting; no central registry needed
    * Cons: Harder to aggregate suggestions for UI; requires reflection to access static fields

**Aspect: Suggestion matching algorithm**

* **Option 1 (current choice):** Simple prefix matching (linear search through sorted list)
    * Pros: Predictable; easy to understand; fast for small command sets (< 50 commands)
    * Cons: Not fuzzy; doesn't handle typos

* **Option 2:** Fuzzy matching with edit distance
    * Pros: More forgiving; better user experience for typos
    * Cons: More complex; slower for large command sets; may suggest unintended commands

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" width="400px"/> <-

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" width="400px"/> <-

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" width="400px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" width="400px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" width="550px"/> <-

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" width="500px"/> <-

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" width="400px"/> <-

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

-> <puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" width="500px"/> <-

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

-> <puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="300px"/> <-

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

    * Expected: The contact `Test User` is still present.

### Handling corrupted or edge-case save files

<box type="info">

The following tests require direct editing of `TAA_savefile.json` in the `data` folder.<br>
Back up the file before each test if you intend to continue using the existing data in your save file.

</box>

#### Blank save file

1. Delete all contents in `TAA_savefile.json`.

<p></p>

2. Launch TAA with `java -jar TAA.jar`.
    * Expected: Sample data is loaded. The app starts normally.

### Malformed JSON

1. Replace the contents of `TAA_savefile.json` with invalid JSON (e.g., `{ "persons": [`).

<p></p>

2. Launch TAA.
    * Expected: TAA starts with an empty address book and displays a warning. All save operations are blocked for this session to prevent overwriting the original file.

### Contact referencing a non-existent group

1. In `TAA_savefile.json`, add a contact whose `groups` array references a group name not present in the `groups` array.
   * Alternatively, edit an existing `groups` array inside a person of sample data to reference a group that does not exist.
   * Example: Edit `2026-S1-T01` for `Alex Yeoh` to `2026-S1-T15`.

<p></p>

2. Launch TAA.
    * Expected: 
      * That contact is skipped and not loaded.
      * TAA starts with the remaining valid entries. 
      * A load warning is displayed on startup. 
      * The skipped entry is preserved in `preservedSkippedPersons` in the save file.

### Contact with an invalid matric number

1. Manually edit a contact's `matricNumber` field to an invalid value (example: `A0000000Z`).

<p></p>

2. Launch TAA.
    * Expected: 
      * That contact is skipped. 
      * A load warning is displayed. 
      * The remaining contacts load normally.

### Contact with an assignment grade exceeding max marks

1. Prerequisites: Ensure the contact's other fields are valid, otherwise the matric number error will be reported first (from [Contact with an invalid matric number](#contact-with-an-invalid-matric-number)).

2. Edit a contact's grade for an assignment to a value greater than the assignment's `maxMarks`.

<p></p>

3. Launch TAA.
    * Expected: 
      * That contact is skipped. 
      * A load warning is displayed. 
      * Other contacts load normally.

## Appendix: Effort

### Difficulties & Challenges

One major challenge was evolving AddressBook into a domain-specific application for TAs while still keeping the codebase maintainable. In particular, extending the model to support tutorial groups, per-group sessions, attendance, participation, and assignment grades required careful design to avoid tightly coupling unrelated features.

Another challenge was preserving a smooth CLI workflow while introducing richer group-based and date-based operations. Commands such as attendance marking, participation recording, session management, and view filtering required additional parser and model logic, while still needing to remain intuitive for users.

The team also had to ensure that invalid or partially corrupted saved data would not cause the entire application to fail. This required additional validation and recovery logic during loading, together with meaningful warnings for the user.

### Effort & Achievements

The project required substantial effort in both feature development and adaptation of the original architecture. Compared to the original AB3 codebase, TAA now supports tutorial-group management, attendance and participation tracking by session date, assignment management within groups, and filtered class views for teaching workflows.

The team also improved robustness by validating saved data during loading, preserving skipped invalid entries, and surfacing warnings to the user instead of failing silently. On the UI side, the app was adapted to support attendance-oriented views and clearer group/session context.

Overall, our team successfully transformed a generic contact-management application into a more task-focused teaching assistant management tool while preserving the strengths of the original CLI-based workflow.

## Appendix: Planned Enhancements

Team size: 5

1. **Improve session and assignment grade error reporting during save file loading**: Currently, when a manually edited contact has multiple invalid session or assignment grade fields, only the first error among them is reported, requiring multiple fix-and-relaunch cycles to fully correct the entry. We plan to accumulate and report all such errors together in a single warning message, consistent with how basic field errors (name, phone, email, matric number, tags) are already reported together.

2. **Use a leaner JSON representation for group sessions**:
   Currently, group sessions are serialized using the same `JsonAdaptedSession` class as person sessions, which includes attendance and participation fields. Group sessions are always reconstructed with UNINITIALISED attendance and 0 participation, so they carry no information.
   We plan to have a dedicated JsonAdaptedGroupSession class that serializes only the date and note fields, producing a leaner save file and making the data model's intent clearer.
