# TAA User Guide

Teacher Assistant's Assistant (TAA) is a **desktop app for Manage all student-related TA matters onto one platform via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAA can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

<!-- * Table of Contents -->
<page-nav-print />

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [here](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/releases/latest).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar addressbook.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list` : Lists all contacts.

   * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com m/A1234567X t/friends t/owesMoney` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * `delete i/3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * `clear` : Deletes all contacts.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE`, `p/PHONE n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

* `gradea a/ASSIGNMENT_NAME i/INDEX_EXPRESSION gr/GRADE` or `gradea a/ASSIGNMENT_NAME m/MATRIC_NUMBER gr/GRADE` assigns grades to students in the current group.

Examples:
* `createa a/Quiz 1 d/2026-04-05 mm/20`
* `lista`
* `gradea a/Quiz 1 i/1,3-5 gr/17`

**Tip:** Not including STATUS as a parameter shows:
* attendance status as [ ] Absent, [X] Present, [-] Uninitialised
* class participation score
* a per-student summary column with attendance totals and average participation

You can optionally narrow the visible session columns with a date range:

Examples:
* `addsession d/2026-03-16`
* `addsession d/2026-03-16 n/tutorial`
* `addsession d/2026-03-16 g/T01`

* If `g/GROUP_NAME` is omitted, the session is deleted from the current class space view.
* If the deleted date is currently highlighted in `view`, the highlight is cleared.
* The command asks for confirmation first. Re-run the same command with `confirm` in front to proceed.

Examples:
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16`
* `deletesession confirm d/2026-03-16`
* `deletesession d/2026-03-16 g/T01`

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<panel id="faq-backup" header="How do I back up my data?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
2. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
3. Copy the `data` folder to another location of your choice.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-transfer" header="How do I transfer my data to another computer?" type="seamless" expanded>

1. Ensure you have the [latest version of TAA installed](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-F14-1/tp/releases) on the new computer.
2. On your old computer, open the folder where `TAA.jar` is located.
3. Locate the `data` folder, which contains `TAA_savefile.json`.
4. Copy this `data` folder into another location of your choice on your new computer.
5. Launch TAA on your new computer. A new `data` folder will be created. Replace this with the version from your old computer.
6. Relaunch TAA. Your data should appear as they did in your old computer.

</panel>

<panel id="faq-unknown_sections" header="I see `preservedSkippedPersons`, `preservedSkippedGroups` and `loadWarnings` in my data file. What are they?" type="seamless" expanded>

These sections will be loaded into your data file once you start TAA.

```json
  "preservedSkippedPersons" : [ ],
  "preservedSkippedGroups" : [ ],
  "loadWarnings" : [ ]
```

* `preservedSkippedPersons` holds all invalid person contacts.
* `preservedSkippedGroups` holds all invalid groups.
* `loadWarnings` holds warning messages, telling you why the respective person(s) or group(s) are invalid. <br>

<box type="tip">

**Tip:**
You can read the <code>loadWarnings</code> as a reference to fix your data file. <br> These warnings will be regenerated once you rerun TAA to inform you of any errors remaining.
</box>

</panel>

<panel id="faq-invalid_persons" header="What happens if my manually edited person contacts are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many contacts are invalid once TAA starts running.

<box type="warning">

**Warning:**
Please close TAA before fixing the contacts, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the data file to see the errors for each contact.
</box>
You can fix the invalid contacts by editing them in the <code>preservedSkippedPersons</code> section of the data file.<br>
Once these contacts are valid, TAA will automatically load these contacts on the next run and clear the <code>loadWarnings</code>.
<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedPersons` looks like with an invalid contact!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
"preservedSkippedPersons" : [ {
    "name" : "John",
    "phone" : "12345678",
    "email" : "example@gmail.com",
    "matricNumber" : "A1234567Y",
    "attendance" : "PRESENT",
    "participation" : 3,
    "tags" : [ ],
    "groups" : [ "T02" ],
    "groupSessions" : {
      "T02" : [ {
        "date" : "2026-03-06",
        "attendance" : "PRESENT",
        "participation" : 3,
        "note" : ""
      } ]
    },
    "assignmentGrades" : {
      "T02" : {
        "Assignment 1" : 100
      }
    }
  } ]
"loadWarnings" : [ "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- The matriculation number checksum letter is incorrect. For the given digits, it should be 'X'." ]
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that `John` has an invalid matriculation number checksum and that it should be `X`. We can fix this by editing the matriculation number from `A1234567Y` to `A1234567X`. <br>
Rerun TAA and `John` will now be loaded into the contact list!

</panel>

<panel id="faq-invalid_groups" header="What happens if my manually edited groups are invalid?" type="seamless" expanded>

You will see an error message telling you how many groups are invalid once TAA starts running.

<box type="warning">

**Warning:**
Please close TAA before fixing the groups, or your changes will be lost. <br>
You can also refer to `loadWarnings` in the data file to see the errors for each group.

</box>

<box type="info">

**Info:**
Contacts that reference invalid groups will be considered invalid and moved to `preservedSkippedPersons`.<br>
They will automatically be loaded back once the invalid group is fixed in `preservedSkippedGroups`.

</box>

You can fix the invalid groups by editing them in the <code>preservedSkippedGroups</code> section of the data file.<br>
Once the groups are valid, TAA will automatically load these groups on the next run and clear the <code>loadWarnings</code>.

<panel header="Here's an example of how `preservedSkippedGroups` looks like with an invalid group!" type="seamless" expanded>

```json
"preservedSkippedPersons" : [ {
    "name" : "John",
    "phone" : "12345678",
    "email" : "example@gmail.com",
    "matricNumber" : "A1234567X",
    "attendance" : "PRESENT",
    "participation" : 3,
    "tags" : [ ],
    "groups" : [ "T02" ],
    "groupSessions" : {
      "T02" : [ {
        "date" : "2026-03-06",
        "attendance" : "PRESENT",
        "participation" : 3,
        "note" : ""
      } ]
    },
    "assignmentGrades" : {
      "T02" : {
        "Assignment 1" : 100
      }
    }
  } ],
  "preservedSkippedGroups" : [ {
    "name" : "T02#",
    "assignments" : [ {
      "name" : "Assignment 1",
      "dueDate" : "2026-05-01",
      "maxMarks" : 100
    } ]
  } ],
  "loadWarnings" : [ "Skipped invalid group 'T02#':\n- Group names should only contain letters, numbers, spaces, hyphens, and underscores, and it should not be blank.", "Skipped invalid contact 'John':\n- Person references group 'T02' which does not exist in the address book." ]
```

The `loadWarnings` tell us that the group `T02#` contains an illegal character, and `John` is invalid since group `T02` does not exist. We can fix this by fixing the group name to be `T02` in `preservedSkippedGroups`.<br>
Rerun TAA and group `T02` will exist. `John` will also be loaded into the contact list and remains a part of `T02`!
